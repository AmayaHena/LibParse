A try to make an easy and useful lib to parse things

I'll try to update often

You can find documentation in Wiki section, on github repo

Lib progress :

- fileManager : Done
- formatParser JSON : Done
- formatParser XML : Done (Writing Doc / WARNING : very basic)
- typeConv : Done (but idk what to do)


To build the project, cmake is required.

You can use the script :
```
chmod 755 && ./build.sh
```

You can also do the manual command line :
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

I hope that will help you or accelerate your productivity.
