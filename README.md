I am currently reworking this lib to make something cleaner, I'll change some features

---

A try to make an easy and useful lib to parse things

Nyx contains :

- fileManager (Gestion & Parsing of File(s))
- formatParser (Parsing of JSON & XML)
- typeConv (Stupid conversion, usefull for parsing)

---

To build the project, cmake is required.

You can use the script :
```
./build.sh
```

You can also do the manual command line :
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

I hope that will help you or accelerate your productivity.
