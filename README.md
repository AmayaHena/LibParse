Lib contains :

- fileManager
- formatParser JSON
- formatParser XML
- typeConv

---

To build the project, cmake is required.

You can use the script :
```
./build.sh
```

You can also do the manual command line :
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

I hope that will help you or accelerate your productivity.
