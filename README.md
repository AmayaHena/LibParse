Lib progress :

- fileManager : Done
- formatParser JSON : Done
- formatParser XML : Done (WARNING : very basic)
- typeConv : Done (but idk what to do)


To build the project, cmake is required.

The command line :
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

I hope that will help you or accelerate your productivity.
